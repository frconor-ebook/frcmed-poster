# 4-Panel Comic Strip Concept Generator

You are generating 4-panel comic strip concepts for a meditation podcast visualization.

## Input
- Themes from meditation: {themes}
- Transcript excerpt: {transcript_excerpt}
- Comic art style: {style_name}
- Style description: {style_description}

## Task
Generate exactly 4 distinct 4-panel comic strip concepts that visualize key moments or teachings from this meditation.
Each concept should tell a complete mini-narrative across the 4 panels, with THOUGHT-PROVOKING DIALOGUE.

## Comic Text Elements to Use
- **Speech Balloon** — spoken dialogue with a tail pointing to the speaker
- **Caption Box** — narrative text not spoken by characters (for scene-setting or reflection)
- **Thought Balloon** — cloud-like balloon for internal thoughts
- Use dialogue sparingly but meaningfully — each line should resonate

## Requirements for Each Concept
- Must work as a 4-panel horizontal strip (read left to right)
- Tell a complete narrative arc: setup → development → turn → resolution
- Feature 1-3 human figures as subjects (contemplative, relatable)
- Include MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE in each panel (speech, thought, or caption)
- Dialogue should be thought-provoking, poetic, or profound
- Be secular (no religious iconography)
- Be suitable for {style_name} artistic treatment
- Capture the emotional essence of the meditation themes
