        "style_description": "in the style of Moebius and European graphic novels, with clean confident contours, cinematic staging, and atmospheric color",
        "linework": "confident continuous contours with selective line breaks, 2-4 line weights, heavier outer contours for figures, thinner for backgrounds",
        "color": "mid-tone wash base, limited palette of 6-12 colors, atmospheric perspective with cooler distant elements, watercolor/gouache feel with paper grain",
        "composition": "cinematic blocking with strong foreground shapes, negative space for breathing room, single primary light direction per panel",
        "technique": "finished painting surfaces without losing line clarity, elegant slightly elongated proportions, expressive hands"

        "style_description": "in watercolor impressionist comic style like Jillian Tamaki or Ghibli backgrounds, with loose intentional lines and emotional color washes",
        "linework": "very light pencil-like lines that disappear into paint, or thin delicate incomplete ink lines, gesture-first drawing",
        "color": "wet-on-wet watercolor blooms, emotional palette per panel, local color looseness (skin can be lavender, shadows can be teal), saturated accents for story beats",
        "composition": "generous margins, soft backgrounds, paper as environment, lost-and-found edges dissolving into washes",
        "technique": "watercolor behaviors - blooms, granulation, dry-brush texture, controlled backruns, big value groupings not careful shading"

        "color": "minimal color - one accent hue or 2-3 washes maximum, color as rough stains that ignore edges slightly",
        "composition": "asymmetry, off-center subjects, tilted horizons, uneven margins, gesture and stroke direction communicating emotion",
        "technique": "dry brush scratch texture, ink wash pools that bleed, controlled splatter in designated zones, negative space as active shape"
